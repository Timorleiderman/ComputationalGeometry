    "First, let's assume that there are two such polygons, $P_1$ and $P_2$, with vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ respectively. Since $P_1$ contains all the points in $p$, it must also contain $v_2$. Similarly, $P_2$ contains all the points in $p$, so it must also contain $v_1$. \n",

    "Now, consider the line segment connecting $v_1$ and $v_2$. Since both $v_1$ and $v_2$ are vertices of $P_1$ and $P_2$, this line segment lies entirely within both polygons. However, since both $P_1$ and $P_2$ are convex, this line segment must also lie entirely within the intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$ is a convex set that contains all the points in $p$, and it must also contain the line segment connecting $v_1$ and $v_2$. This means that the intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$ is a convex polygon with vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since $P_1$ and $P_2$ were assumed to be two different polygons that contain all the points in $p$, this means that the intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$ is a convex polygon that is contained within both $P_1$ and $P_2$. But this is only possible if $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the same polygon. Therefore, the polygon $P$ is uniquely defined.\n",

    "To prove that $P$ is the intersection of all convex sets containing $p$, we need to show that $P$ is contained within any convex set that contains all the points in $p$, and that $P$ contains all the points in $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's consider any convex set $C$ that contains all the points in $p$. Since $C$ is convex, it must contain all the line segments connecting any two points in $p$. This means that $C$ must contain all the line segments connecting the vertices of $P$. But the vertices of $P$ are points from $p$, so $C$ must contain all the vertices of $P$. \n",

    "Since $C$ contains all the vertices of $P$, it must also contain all the line segments connecting these vertices. But these line segments are the edges of $P$, so $C$ must contain all the edges of $P$. \n",
